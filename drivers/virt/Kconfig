config VMGENID

	depends on ACPI && SYSGENID
	help
	  The driver uses the hypervisor provided Virtual Machine Generation ID
	  to drive the system generation counter mechanism exposed by sysgenid.
	  The vmgenid changes on VM snapshots or VM cloning. The hypervisor
	  provided 128-bit vmgenid is also used as device randomness to improve
	  kernel entropy following VM snapshot events.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called vmgenid.

config FSL_HV_MANAGER

	select EPAPR_PARAVIRT
	help
          The Freescale hypervisor management driver provides several services
	  to drivers and applications related to the Freescale hypervisor:

          1) An ioctl interface for querying and managing partitions.

          2) A file interface to reading incoming doorbells.

          3) An interrupt handler for shutting down the partition upon
	     receiving the shutdown doorbell from a manager partition.

          4) A kernel interface for receiving callbacks when a managed
	     partition shuts down.
